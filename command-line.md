From my perspective, the command line is the simple words map for a computers brain.

mkdir /make a new folder
ls /show whats inside 
cd /change directory
rm /remove a file
git clone /take copy of a rep
git push origin master /send my changing to master brunch 
git branch /list of your brunches and where are you currently
git init /creat new local rep
pwd /which directory you are currently
exit / leave the terminal
